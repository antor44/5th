# Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind

MSX game developed with default Basic in text mode, no machine code

5th is the version compatible with MSX1

5th_sp is the version with speech synthesis, it requires the binary file tavmsx.bin (TAVMSX beta 4 for MSX1, by Pastbytes), but the game requires at least MSX2
